These are the results of the new method applied on the problem sets with
distance matrices.

Notable things about this version:
- Added a backup pool in case the Pareto set approximation is too small. When 
    ever the backup pool is used, it is clipped to the size (minimum_population 
    - len(pareto_set_approximation)) according to the fitness values. The 
    fitness values are calculated according to the IBEA paper. The differences
    are: we take the sum of the indicator values instead of the sum of 
    exponential, and we then take the exponential of the sums.
