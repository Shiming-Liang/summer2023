These are the results of the new method applied on the problem sets with
distance matrices.

Notable things about this version:
- For the extreme point search, we initialize the solution using a random 
    subset with half the number of all vertices in the problem
- Modified the drop operator such that it terminate when the route length hit
    half of the route length constraint
- We now run extreme point search multiple times
- The result is still not good.
