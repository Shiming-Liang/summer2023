These are the results of the new method applied on the problem sets with
distance matrices.

Notable things about this version:
- fixed problems on closed tours: in tour, it needs additional condition to 
    tell if a vertices is visited. Because the permutation[start] = end and 
    start == end. 
- change the bcr compuatation to deal with negative cost(before: benefit/cost, 
    now: benefit/cost when cost > 1, benefit*(2-cost) otherwise)
- tested on the dmatrix problem sets, the result is not very good
