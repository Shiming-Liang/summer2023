These are the results of the new method applied on the problem sets with
Euclidean coordinations.

Notable things about this version:
- Added early stop for the shorten operator if there is no need for shortening
- More efficient sorting of the pq_list in the add operator
- The add operator now returns when all the priority queues are infeasible 
    instead of when the one with lowest negative bcr is infeasible
- The program now output the results with the correct tag instead of MOABC
- The crossover operator now produce the new weight with the average weights 
    of the parents
- The Pareto update now first check for repetition and then do the Pareto 
    comparision, because checking existence of a key in a dict is O(1), 
    and the for loop will take forever to check repetition
