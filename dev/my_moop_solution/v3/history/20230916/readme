These are the results of the new method applied on the problem sets with
distance matrices.

Notable things about this version:
- The add operator now add random new vertex to the solution
- The drop operator now only consider distance cost
- The whole scheme is now more classic EA'ish: with initialization, select and
    mutate
- The new mutate function is added
- The number of vertices to add at each iteration is set to be propotional to
    the size of the problem
